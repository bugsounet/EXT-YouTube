# MMM-YouTube

Hi, I'm writing a new MMM-YouTube module (version 2022 ?)<br>
I now able to play any YT video without VLC program<br>

# Why refact a Youtube module ?
I see to many issue with VLC program and i don't like that ...<br>
I search to make simple things ... plug and play<br>
I want a natural player without problem<br>
So... Go back to the source !<br>
We use the real YouTube API in Javascript<br>
I see some user that think... `we can't play © video with it...`<br>
Effectively, we can't read directly © video in embed iframe with full JS Code for MagicMirror !<br>

So... I think to another method... we have an dedicated server... and why not create a YT server on it ?<br>
Right! I Code it !<br>
